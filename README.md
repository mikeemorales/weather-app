## HOW IT WORKS
- Enter a location in the search bar and the data populated will show Location, Date, Temperature (Fahrenheit), and Visibility.
- This is a global search. You may need to include the state or country. e.g => 'Long Beach, California' or 'Mexico City, MX'.
- Depending on the location's temperature, the background should change from cool to warm. warm is set to temp >= 75Â°F.

## STACK
- React.js
- CSS3

## API
- OpenWeatherMap.org API is being called to generate and display json data.
